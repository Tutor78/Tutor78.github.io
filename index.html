                    Born in 1992 in Memphis, Tennessee, I grew up in rural Arkansas right across the river in a small town known as Marion. As a kid I highly enjoyed 
                    the outdoors and became a scout at an early age. I continued with this through to a life scout. I attended a private school in my hometown until my 
                    junior year. While at this school, I took a liking to math and history excelling in both. I took part in the founding of our school's robotic team 
                    my sophomore year before switching to another school to finish my last two years. Following my graduation I did a brief stint in the U.S. Navy where I served as 
                    a Boatswain's Mate Third Class before leaving the service. This was followed by a few years of working on the western river system as a 
                    barge tankerman PIC where I continued to improve both my work ethic and leadership abilities. I then switched to resteraunt work where I 
                    did time as a server, bartender, and eventually manager in charge of two stores at the same time. I have also worked in landscaping as both a gardener and crew leader.

                    In my time off I enjoy making music and have built a small homestudio that I use to record myself and my friends. I have released one song on spotify 
                    and have worked on other projects such as wedding audio. Outside of work music is my life. I listen to all types of music and before the pandemic frequently 
                    went to concerts and also attended a handful of festivals. When not working on music I tend to enjoy video games and am a huge fan of strategy games though 
                    I tend to play FPS games such as Valorant with my friends from Germany about the same amount. I love to travel, having been an exchange student in Japan, and still 
                    have a passion for the outdoors.
